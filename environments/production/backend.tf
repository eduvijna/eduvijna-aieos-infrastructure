#   use_lockfile = true (native lockfile; no DynamoDB)
#   CDN: OFF / unused
#   Public access: FORBIDDEN
#
# STAGE 2 (PASS / FORMALLY CLOSED):
#   Authorized operator workspace completed remote S3 backend initialization
#   using external non-secret backend-config + process-local credential loading.
#   Credentials were never persisted in source, .tfbackend, or Git.
#
# STAGE 3A (PASS / FORMALLY CLOSED):
#   Bounded refresh-only production plan; native S3 live-lock cycle validated;
#   zero managed resources; no DigitalOcean workload mutation.
#
# STAGE 3B (PASS / FORMALLY CLOSED):
#   First authoritative remote tfstate materialization via exact inspected
#   refresh-only saved-plan apply; 0 added / 0 changed / 0 destroyed.
#   Remote tfstate: MATERIALIZED / AUTHORITATIVE
#   Key: environments/production/opentofu.tfstate
#   Initial serial: 1
#   Managed resource count: 0
#   Current persistent lock: ABSENT
#   Native locking: VALIDATED
#
# Normal production workload plan: NOT AUTHORIZED
# Further production apply: NOT AUTHORIZED
# enable_cloud_resources remains false by default
#
# SOURCE REMAINS INTENTIONALLY PARTIAL / NON-SECRET.
# CI uses: tofu init -backend=false
# A clean or future production operator workspace requires a fresh explicit
# Chief Architect execution gate before production backend initialization.
#
# WORKLOAD vs CONTROL-PLANE (ADR-AIEOS-044R2):
#   Production workload region remains BLR1.
#   OpenTofu production-state location is SFO3 only.
